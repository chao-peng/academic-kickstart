Chao Peng （彭péng, 超chāo）

I am a Tech Expert / Senior Researcher at [ByteDance (字节跳动)](https://www.bytedance.com) working on software quality assurance.
I received my PhD degree from [Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS)](http://wcms.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs), [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) under supervision of [Dr. Ajitha Rajan](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/arajan).

At ByteDance, I am on the Quality Lab team. My research interest lies in the area of software testing, maintenance and quality assurance, and the synergy with machine learning and compiler techniques.

I am passionate about building practical software testing, analysis, and debugging systems to predict, detect, diagnose, and fix bugs for all kinds of software systems.


Outside of work, I enjoy going to the gym.
