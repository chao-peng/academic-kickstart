Chao Peng （彭péng, 超chāo）

I am a Principal Research Scientist at [ByteDance (字节跳动)](https://www.bytedance.com).
I received my PhD degree from [Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS)](http://wcms.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs), [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) under supervision of [Prof. Ajitha Rajan](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/arajan).

At ByteDance, I lead the [Software Engineering Lab](https://se-research.bytedance.com), where we conduct research on AI agents for software engineering. My research interest lies in the area of software testing, program repair and optimisations, and the synergy with machine learning and compiler techniques. I am also responsible for academic development and university collaboration.

<!--I am passionate about building practical software testing, analysis, and debugging systems to predict, detect, diagnose, and fix bugs for all kinds of software systems.-->

Outside of work, I enjoy going to the gym.
