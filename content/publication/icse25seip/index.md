abstract: "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly integral to enhancing developer productivity, particularly in code generation, comprehension, and repair tasks. However, fine-tuning these models with high-quality, real-world data is challenging due to privacy concerns and the lack of accessible, labeled datasets. In this paper, we present DialogAgent, an automated tool for generating synthetic training data that closely mimics real developer interactions within Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). DialogAgent enables the production of diverse, high-fidelity query-response pairs by simulating multi-turn dialogues and contextual behaviors observed in real-world programming scenarios. The tool significantly reduces the reliance on manual data generation, increasing efficiency by 4.8 times compared to traditional methods. Our experiments and online deployment demonstrate substantial improvements in model performance for code-related question-answering tasks: the acceptance rate of responses generated by our in-house model is improved by 33%, after training on synthesized data generated by DialogAgent."
